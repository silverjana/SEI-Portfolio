        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>While working in the travel industry as a tour operator, I noticed how some websites and software I used daily needed technical improvement as it really impacted my productivity. 
          This is where my curiosity for coding started and eventually led me to a career change. <br />
          I realised that coding encompasses multiple aspects which are important to me. Indeed, I grew up in a multicultural environment and graduated with a BA in Languages and Literature, and I saw similarities with programming and the multitude of technical languages. 
          I also find great satisfaction solving problems and influencing others positively, especially by building and crafting solutions, which I can find again in programming. 
          This is why I decided to complete a software engineering immersive course, in order to start a career as a Developer and join a collaborative team,
          working on challenging and purposeful projects. <br />
          I took the course while in London and at the moment I'm based in Rome - Italy, but am happy to move for an interesting position! </p>
